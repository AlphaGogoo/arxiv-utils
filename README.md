For ArXiv PDF / abstract tabs, renames the title and add a button to open its corresponding abstract / PDF page.

- [arXiv-title-fixer](https://github.com/musically-ut/arXiv-title-fixer) that works well on Google Chrome.
  This requires a button click to change the pdf title, but will be considered less intrusive than running in the background.
- [arxiv-url](https://github.com/weakish/arxiv-url)
  This claims to add a back button, but I can't get it working.
